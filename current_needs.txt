Need to implement a way to track how many bytes were used by a tag, and then use that to remove or index for the next tag. Right now
the bytes from the compound tag are passed to the first next tag, but we should somehow update the number of bytes used and remove
each iteration.

Need to implement what to do with bytes passed to each tag type.
